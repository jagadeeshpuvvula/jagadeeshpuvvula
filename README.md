Hi there 👋

I am an epidemiologist working at the intersection between 🌍 environmental exposures and 🏥 adverse human health outcomes.

🔬 Research Focus

I primarily focus on:

🧠 Neurodevelopmental outcomes
🧬 Neurodegenerative conditions
👶 Birth Outcomes
🧬 Multi-Omics Integration

My work involves integration of biological intermediates to understand exposure-response mechanistic associations:

🔗 Epigenome - DNA methylation patterns and histone modifications
📊 Transcriptome - Gene expression profiling and RNA sequencing
🛡️ Proteome - Protein expression and functional analysis
⚗️ Metabolome - Small molecule metabolite profiling
🎓 Academic Positions

🏛️ Current

Instructor of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine
NIH NIEHS K99 Fellow 🏆
📚 Education Journey

Post-doctoral Fellow (2022-2024) | University of Pennsylvania with Dr. Aimin Chen
PhD in Environmental Health & Toxicology (2022) | University of Nebraska Medical Center with Dr. Jesse Bell
MPH in Epidemiology
PharmD degree
